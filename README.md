# Simple-Multiclient-server-and-a-client
The server is for multiclient connection and it only can broadcast the clients messages. Careful, it has some bugs. Other than that you have to use it on a lan connection.
# You might be able to use it publicly by using something called 'Radmin Vpn'. You basically connect computers with it and have a separate ip adress in the 'radmin dimension'.
# So knowing that ip you can put it in the client side and then connect
